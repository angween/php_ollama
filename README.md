# Ollama with PHP

Trying to access [Ollama](https://ollama.com) with PHP. Main purpose is to connect the AI with Database (MySQL/MariaDB in my case). Make sure you have installed and running Ollama on your system.

For this test I'm using PHP 8.2^ and MariaDB.

For LLM's model on Ollama I'm using:
1. LLama3: from Meta
2. Qwen2: from Alibaba, good for other language beside English
